# AGENTS.md

This is **sift** -- a tool for surfacing and managing Obsidian Tasks from outside Obsidian.

## Project overview

Sift reads and writes tasks from an Obsidian vault that uses the [Obsidian Tasks](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/) plugin with **emoji format**. It provides multiple interfaces (CLI, Raycast, AI agent) on top of a shared core library.

## Architecture

This is a TypeScript monorepo using npm workspaces.

```
sift/
├── packages/
│   ├── core/       # Shared library: parser, scanner, writer, config
│   ├── cli/        # Command-line interface (commander.js)
│   └── raycast/    # Raycast extension (React + @raycast/api)
```

All interfaces depend on `@sift/core`. The core package has zero UI concerns -- it reads/writes markdown files and returns structured data.

### Agent integration

The agent integration files are in `packages/agent-skill/`:

**MCP Server (for Claude Code & Claude Desktop):**
- `packages/agent-skill/mcp-server.ts` -- MCP server providing sift tools
- Tools: `sift_list`, `sift_next`, `sift_summary`, `sift_add`, `sift_find`, `sift_done`, `sift_projects`, `sift_project_create`, `sift_project_path`, `sift_note`, `sift_review`

**Agent Skill (all agents):**
- `packages/agent-skill/SKILL.md` -- Skill definition
- `packages/agent-skill/tools/sift.ts` -- OpenCode custom tools
- `skills/sift/` -- Symlinks for `npx skills add dru89/sift` compatibility
- Install via `npx skills add dru89/sift -g`

Both implementations resolve the CLI dynamically (from PATH or `SIFT_CLI_PATH` env var) rather than hardcoding a path.

## Key concepts

### Obsidian Tasks emoji format

Tasks look like this in markdown:

```markdown
- [ ] Task description ⏫ ⏳ 2026-03-07 📅 2026-03-10
- [x] Completed task 🔼 ✅ 2026-03-06
```

Emoji meanings:
- Priority: `⏫` highest, `🔼` high, `🔽` low, `⏬` lowest
- Dates: `⏳` scheduled, `📅` due, `🛫` start, `✅` done
- Recurrence: `🔁` followed by rule text (e.g., "every week")

### Configuration

Sift resolves its config in this order:
1. Explicit overrides passed to functions
2. `SIFT_VAULT_PATH` environment variable
3. `~/.siftrc.json`
4. `./.siftrc.json`

The config file looks like:
```json
{
  "vaultPath": "/path/to/vault",
  "dailyNotesPath": "Daily Notes",
  "dailyNotesFormat": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "excludeFolders": ["Templates", "Attachments"],
  "projectsPath": "Projects",
  "projectTemplatePath": "Templates/Project.md"
}
```

A per-repo `.siftrc.json` can also include a `project` field to associate the working directory with a vault project:
```json
{
  "project": "MP3 Parser"
}
```

### Task scanning

The scanner (`packages/core/src/scanner.ts`) walks all `.md` files in the vault, skipping excluded folders and root-level ALL_CAPS files (setup/reference docs). It parses every line looking for `- [ ]` or `- [x]` patterns and extracts metadata.

### Task writing

New tasks are added under the `## Journal` heading in today's daily note. If the daily note doesn't exist, it's created from a template that matches the user's existing format (frontmatter, tasks query block, journal section, dataview query, navigation links).

Tasks can also be added to project files using `addTask()` with the `project` option (or `sift add --project`). When targeting a project, the task is inserted under the `## Tasks` heading in the project file.

### Projects

Projects are markdown files in the configured `projectsPath` folder (default: `Projects/`) that have `type: project` in their YAML frontmatter. The core library provides:

- `listProjects()` -- scans the projects folder and returns metadata for all project files
- `findProject()` -- case-insensitive lookup by name
- `createProject()` -- creates a new project file from the configured template (stripping Templater syntax)

### Safe task completion

Task completion uses a two-step flow to prevent accidentally marking the wrong task:

1. `findTasks(config, search)` -- searches open tasks by description substring, returns matches with file paths and line numbers
2. `completeTask(config, filePath, lineNumber)` -- marks a specific task as done by precise file+line location

The CLI `sift done` command supports both modes: search-based (`sift done "search term"`) and precise (`sift done --file "path" --line N`). Agent tools follow the same pattern.

### Notes and changelog

Freeform notes (not tasks) can be added with `addNote()` or `sift note`. Notes go under `## Journal` in the daily note by default, or `## Notes` in project files.

When a note is added to a project, a one-line dated summary is automatically appended under `## Changelog` in the project file:

```markdown
## Changelog
- **2026-03-10:** Decided to use ID3v2.4 format
- **2026-03-08:** Added initial research notes
```

Only notes create changelog entries (not tasks). The summary is auto-generated from the first ~80 characters of the note content, or can be explicitly provided via `changelogSummary` in `AddNoteOptions`.

### Review

The review system provides a summary of activity over a time period. `getReviewSummary()` (in the scanner) returns a `ReviewSummary` with:

- **Completed tasks**: tasks with a `✅` date in the review period
- **Created & still open**: tasks with a `➕` date in the period that are still open
- **Stale tasks**: open tasks with no due or scheduled date (may need triage)
- **Changelog entries**: dated summaries aggregated from all project `## Changelog` sections
- **Upcoming tasks**: tasks due in the 7 days after the review period

The default review period is "since last Friday" through today, designed for a weekly review cadence. The CLI `sift review` command accepts `--since <date>`, `--until <date>`, and `--days <N>` flags.

## Building

```bash
npm install
npm run build        # builds all packages
```

The CLI is the primary entry point. After building:
```bash
node packages/cli/dist/index.js summary
```

Or if linked globally:
```bash
sift summary
```

## Package details

### @sift/core (`packages/core/`)

Pure library, no CLI or UI. Key exports:

- **Parser**: `parseLine()`, `parseContent()`, `formatTask()`
- **Scanner**: `scanTasks()`, `scanFile()`, `getNextTasks()`, `getOverdueTasks()`, `getDueToday()`, `sortByUrgency()`, `getReviewSummary()`, `scanChangelog()`
- **Writer**: `addTask()`, `addTaskToFile()`, `addNote()`, `completeTask()`, `findTasks()`
- **Projects**: `listProjects()`, `findProject()`, `createProject()`
- **Config**: `resolveConfig()`, `writeConfig()`
- **Types**: `Task`, `TaskStatus`, `Priority`, `SiftConfig`, `TaskFilter`, `NewTaskOptions`, `AddNoteOptions`, `ProjectInfo`, `ChangelogEntry`, `ReviewSummary`

### @sift/cli (`packages/cli/`)

Commands: `list`, `next`, `today`, `overdue`, `add`, `done`, `find`, `note`, `review`, `projects`, `project create`, `project path`, `summary`, `init`

Uses commander.js for arg parsing and chalk for terminal output.

### Raycast extension (`packages/raycast/`)

Four commands: Task Summary, List Tasks, Up Next, Add Task. Uses `@raycast/api` React components. Vault path is configured via Raycast extension preferences.

## Code style

- TypeScript with strict mode
- ESM (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- Node16 module resolution
- All imports use `.js` extensions (TypeScript convention for ESM)
- JSDoc comments on all public functions

## Testing

No test framework is set up yet. Tests should be added to each package as `src/__tests__/` directories using vitest or a similar ESM-compatible runner. The parser is the highest priority for unit tests since it handles the most complex logic.
